    "This Bike Sharing project consists of different attributes and each attribute has data values which can be compared with other attributes and get the desired analysis. I have used hourly rental data and compared with the other attributes such as weather, month, temperature, workingdays etc. All these attributes are already defined initially in this document. The main tasks of this project is to understand how these attributes effects the hourly bike rentals in the Washington DC area. This project analysed the data and generated different types of plots univariate(histograms), Bivariate(2D), Multivariate relationships between the attributes or variables. There are two types of users who have taken hourly bike rentals they are casual users and registered users. Registered users have more hourly bike rentals than the casual users. But this project made analysis on both the users by taking count of both the users. The main factors which are effecting on the bike rentals are weather and natural disasters. Hurricane Sandy have effected the business of bike rentals in the month of november, Snow factors also effected the bike rentals in the months of dec-march."
